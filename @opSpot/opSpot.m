classdef opSpot
    %opSpot  Spot operator super class.
    %
    %   A = opSpot  creates an empty Spot operator.
    %
    %   A = opSpot(type,m,n)  creates a Spot operator named TYPE, of size
    %   M-by-N. CFLAG is set when the operator is
    %   complex. The TYPE and DATA fields provide the type of the operator
    %   (string) and additional data for printing.

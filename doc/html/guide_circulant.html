%% Building a Circulant Operator
% In our first example we will use Spot to create an implicit
% circulant matrix and that can be used as a fast operator.  Circulant
% matrices are fully specified by their first column, and each
% remaining column is a cyclic permutation of the first:
%
% $$
% C =  \pmatrix{
%        c_1   & c_{n}      & \ldots & c_2
%    \cr c_2   & c_1        & \ldots & \vdots
%    \cr \vdots& \ddots     & \ddots & c_n
%    \cr c_n   & \ldots     & c_2    & c_1
%     }.
% $$
%
% These matrices have the property that they can be diagonalized by the
% discrete Fourier transform (DFT), so that
%
%   C = F'diag(d)F,
%
% where d = Fc. An important implication is that |C| can be treated as a
% fast operator.

%% Instantiating a simple Spot operator
% In our toy example, we create a circulant matrix whose first column
% is simply the sequence 1,...,5:

n = 5;
c = (1:n)';  % make sure c is a column vector

%%
% Our very first Spot command will create the required DFT operator.
% We omit the semicolon so that Matlab will display details of the
% resulting operator:

F = opDFT(n)

%%
% It's straightforward to apply the resulting DFT operator to a
% vector. The following command applies the Fourier transform to the
% vector |c|, which yields the eigenvalues of |C|:

d = sqrt(n)*F*c

%%
% Notice that we scaled this product by |sqrt(n)|. This is necessary
% because Spot's DFT is scaled so that it's orthogonal, and therefore,
% rather than the first column of |F| being a vector of ones, it's
% scaled by |1/sqrt(n)|. We can see this as follows:

sqrt(n) * double( F(:,1) )

%%
% This last command hints at an important feature of Spot operators
% that allows them to be indexed like explicit Matlab matrices.

%% Building more complex operators
% Finally, we build the circulant operator with the command

C = real( F'*opDiag(d)*F )

%%
% We could have left out the |real| modifier, and used the simpler
% command
%
%   C = F'*opDiag(d)*F
%
% However, we need to safeguard against numerical errors that might
% allow complex values to seep in. Hence, we finish off our
% construction with the |real| operator.

%%
% Just as the DFT operator |F| could be applied to vectors, the
% same is true of the compound operator |C|. Here we apply it to
% the first unit vector:

e = eye(5,1);
C*e

%%
% Let's count the number of times that |C| and |F| were applied to
% vectors:

C.nprods
%%
F.nprods

%%
% The suffix |nprods| gives the number of times that the operator
% acted on a vector: the first element of |X.nprods| tracks the count
% of products with the operator; the second element tracks the count
% of products with its adjoint.  In the first case, we see that |C|
% was only used once (in the command |C*e| above). In the second
% case, we see that |F| acted on a vector a total of 4 timesREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH-3
% with |F| itself, and once with its adjoint. Where did these 4
% products come from? The first is clear, and happened in the
% command |d = sqrt(n)*F*c|. Another multiplication with |F|
% occurred in the command |double( F(:,1) )|, which extracted the
% first column from |F|. Then two more multiplications, one with
% |F| and another with |F'| occurred when we applied |C*e|.

%%
% Let's verify that |C| is indeed circulant. We can do this two ways. The
% first uses the overloaded method |double| which converts a Spot
% operator into an explicit matrix:

double(C)

%%
% The second approach shows that it's possible to apply an operator
% simultaneously to a collection of vectors:

C*eye(n)

%% Operators
% Spot includes several types of operators.  The basic operators implement
% a particular transform (e.g., a Wavelet) or a type of random ensemble
% (e.g., a Gaussian ensemble).  The comprehensive collection of meta
% operators can be used to assemble the basic operators into more
% sophisticated operators.  Finally, the container operators allow users to
% treat other objects (such as function handles and objects from other
% toolboxes) as Spot operators, and thus integrate them with the Spot
% functionality.

classdef opDFT < opOrthogonal
%OPDFT  Fast Fourier transform (DFT).
%
%   opDFT(M) create a unitary one-dimensional discrete Fourier
%   transform (DFT) for vectors of length M.
%
%   opDFT(M,CENTERED), with the CENTERED flag set to true, creates a
%   unitary DFT that shifts the zero-frequency component to the center
%   of the spectrum.

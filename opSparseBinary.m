classdef opSparseBinary < opSpot
%OPSPARSEBINARY   Random sparse binary matrix.
%
%   opSparseBinary(M,N) creates an M-by-N sparse binary matrix with
%   min(M,8) nonzeros in each column.
%
%   opSparseBinary(M,N,D) is the same as above, except that each
%   column has min(M,D) nonzero elements.
%
%   This matrix was suggested by Radu Berinde and Piotr Indyk,
%   "Sparse recovery using sparse random matrices", MIT CSAIL TR
%   2008-001, January 2008, http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/40089
%
%   Note that opSparseBinary calls RANDPERM and thus changes the state
%   of RAND.

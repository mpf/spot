classdef opStack < opSpot
%OPSTACK  Stack of vertically concatenated operators.
%
%   opStack(WEIGHTS, OP1, OP2, ...) creates a stacked
%   operator consisting of the vertical concatenation of all
%   operators;
%
%               [WEIGHT1*OP1
%                WEIGHT2*OP2
%                   ...
%                WEIGHTn*OPn]
%
%   If the same weight is to be applied to each operator, set
%   WEIGHTS to a scalar. When WEIGHTS is empty [], it is set to
%   one. The WEIGHT parameter can be omitted as long as OP1 is not
%   a vector of length (n-1); in which case there is no way to
%   decide whether it is a weight vector or operator.
%
